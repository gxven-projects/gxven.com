## About this website

This website is a copy&paste of a [very good furry coder](https://github.com/Squalish/Squalish.github.io)

It contains stuff like:

``My Bio``, ``My Projects``, ``Socials`` and ``FAQ``.

Oh yeah can't forget about the ``Credits`` which contains resources I used and people that helped me with the site. :3
